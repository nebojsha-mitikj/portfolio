      Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head first
      into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the
      privilege of building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a student-led design
      studio, and a huge corporation.

      My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for our clients at Upstatement.
      In my free time I've also released an online video course that covers everything you need to
      know to build a web app with the Spotify API.
